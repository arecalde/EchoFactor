HELLO!

This file is addressed to future me, potential employer, or some random enthusiast who found this off of the internet.

A little bit about the website, it is a project that I had in high school to recreate Facebook. Not the facebook from now though, the original facebook.
Back from when it was called The Facebook in 2004. That is why the layout looks the way that it does. My design skills are not genuinely that terrible.

The code is written for fun and not for professional or academic reasons and in some areas this shows. The code relies entirely on a MySQL server and PHP, this is the enviroment that
it needs to be ran in. The mailing features of the program are only compatible with the server that it was built on. There is a mysql template included in the file to create the
database. the file includes/connect.php must be filled with credentials to your database. 

A couple notes about the structure of the program:
-The main folder has almost no actual code. Most of the 'meat' of the program is in the content folder
-The file main.php is the heart of the program, it is essentially a template that pulls from the content folder and fills
the template with whatever is needed
-The few files in the main folder were either unique and could not be put in the template, or doing so would require a lot of additional effort or they are helper files
-include 'includer.php'; is a file that includes the navigation bar, the database link, and the main function library
-include 'head.php'; is a file that includes the title and the css that the program uses
-footer is a file that shows legal stuff, and some links to the user
-Anything not addressed here should be covered in file comments
